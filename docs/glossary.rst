   ellipticity (modulus)
      If :math:`q = b/a` is the axis ratio of an elliptical isophote with
      semi-major axis :math:`a` and semi-minor axis :math:`b`, the ellipticity
      modulus is :math:`\epsilon = (1 - q)/(1 + q)`.  The orientation of the
      ellipticity is described by the :term:`ellipticity (complex)`.

   ellipticity (complex)
      If :math:`q = b/a` is the axis ratio of an elliptical isophote with
      semi-major axis :math:`a` and semi-minor axis :math:`b`, and :math:`\phi`
      is the orientation of the elliptical isophote, the complex-valued
      ellipticity is

      .. math::

         \epsilon = \frac{1 - q}{1 + q} \, \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \, 2\phi} \;.

      For ellipticity without the orientation, see :term:`ellipticity
      (modulus)`.
